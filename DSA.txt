🔬 DSA Roadmap: From Basics to Advanced

🔥 1. Learn a Programming Language

    ✨ Choose a language: JavaScript, Java, Python, or any other. ✅ (JavaScript)
    ✨ Ask yourself: “Have I stopped thinking about syntax?” If yes, you’re on the right track. ✅
    ✨ Focus on problem-solving and building a logic-oriented mindset, not just the language. ✅

🔥 2. Big O Notation

    ⌚ Understand:
    ⏳ Time & Space Complexity ✅
    📊 Scalability of code
    📈 Rules and Graphs ✅
    👍🏻 Tip: You can learn this first or last. It’s often easier to do it after gaining hands-on experience. 👍🏻
    📚 Practice a few exercises to strengthen understanding. ✅

🔥 3. Data Structures

    🌐 Types:
        🔸 Singly, Doubly, Circular

    🔄 Implementation:
        🔸 Define a Node with Data and Pointer
        🔸 Use Constructors
        🔸 Work with Head/Tail References
        🔸 Utility Functions: IsEmpty, Size
        🔸 Perform Insertion, Deletion, Searching

    🔐 Advanced Techniques:
        🔸 Two Pointers, Reverse a Linked List
        🔸 Merge and Split Linked Lists

    🔬 Patterns:
        🔸 Detecting Cycles
        🔸 Finding the Middle Node
        🔸 N-th Node from the End

    🕳️ Stack & Queue

    🌐 Stack (LIFO):
        🔸 Basic Operations: Push, Pop, Peek

    🌐 Queue (FIFO):
        🔸 Basic Operations: Add, Remove, Front
        🔸 Circular Queue
        🔸 Handle Underflow and Overflow

    🌐 Applications:
        🔸 BFS, Round Robin Scheduling, Balancing Symbols, Reverse a Queue
        🔸 Thread-safe Implementations

    🌐 Practice: LeetCode (Few problems).
